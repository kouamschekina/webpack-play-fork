# Webpack Play

## Introduction

Webpack Play is a simple project aimed at creating a **todo list application**. Users can:
- Add new tasks
- Delete tasks

This application helps maximize organization and discipline for its users. It is built with **Typescript**, a popular front-end library, and uses **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)** for bundling assets and optimizing performance. 

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=14)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional but recommended)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stephane-segning/webpack-play
2. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    yarn install
3. **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
This will start the webpack development server, and you can view the application at http://localhost:9000.
